PROJECT 1 - Lotus Hotel Suite

Project Description
The Lotus Hotel suite is a specialized management system made custom for the Lotus Hotel. 
The suite consists of four applications; frontdesk, goldpoint, serveright, and staykeep. 
When the four work together, staff can easily manage stays, reservations; and guests can
